description: 'Breakfast, dinner, tea; in extreme cases, breakfast, luncheon, dinner,
  tea, supper, and a glass of something hot at bedtime. What care we take about feeding
  the lucky body! Which of us does as much for his mind? And what causes the difference?
  Is the body so much the more important of the two?  By no means: but life depends
  on the body being fed, whereas we can continue to exist as animals (scarcely as
  men) though the mind be utterly starved and neglected. Therefore Nature provides
  that, in case of serious neglect of the body, such terrible consequences of discomfort
  and pain shall ensue, as will soon bring us back to a sense of our duty: and some
  of the functions necessary to life she does for us altogether, leaving us no choice
  in the matter. It would fare but ill with many of us if we were left to superintend
  our own digestion and circulation. ''Bless me!'' one would cry, ''I forgot to wind
  up my heart this morning! To think that it has been standing still for the last
  three hours!'' ''I can''t walk with you this afternoon,'' a friend would say, ''as
  I have no less than eleven dinners to digest. I had to let them stand over from
  last week, being so busy, and my doctor says he will not answer for the consequences
  if I wait any longer!'''
