<p class="center"><span class="big">NOTE</span></p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="caps">The</span> <i>history of this little sparkle from the pen of Lewis Carroll may soon
be told. It was in October of the year 1884 that he came on a visit to a
certain vicarage in Derbyshire, where he had promised, on the score of
friendship, to do what was for him a most unusual favour&mdash;to give a
lecture before a public audience.</i></p>

<p><i>The writer well remembers his nervous, highly-strung manner as he stood
before the little room full of simple people, few of whom had any idea of
the world-wide reputation of that shy, slight figure before them.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span><i>When the lecture was over, he handed the manuscript to me, saying: &#8216;Do
what you like with it.&#8217;</i></p>

<p><i>The one for whose sake he did this kindness was not long after called</i></p>

<p class="poem">&#8216;Into the Silent Land.&#8217;</p>

<p><i>So the beautifully-written MS., in his customary violet ink, has been
treasured for more than twenty years, only now and then being read over at
Christmastime to a friend or two by the study fire, always to meet with
the same welcome and glad acknowledgment that here was a genuine, though
little flame that could not have belonged to any other source but that
which all the world knew in</i> Alice in Wonderland <i>and</i> Through the
Looking-Glass.</p>

<p><i>There may be, perhaps, many others who, gathering round a winter fire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
will be glad to read words, however few, from that bright source, and
whose memories will respond to the fresh touch of that cherished name.</i></p>

<p><i>It remains to add but one or two more associations that cling to it and
make the remembrance more vivid still. While Lewis Carroll was staying in
the house, there came to call a certain genial and by no means shy Dean,
who, without realizing what he was doing, proceeded, in the presence of
other callers, to make some remark identifying Mr. Dodgson as the author
of his books.</i></p>

<p><i>There followed an immense explosion immediately on the visitor&#8217;s
departure, with a pathetic and serious request that, if there were any
risk of a repetition of the call, due warning might be given, and the
retreat secured.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span><i>Probably not many readers of the immortal Alice have ever seen the
curious little whimsical paper called</i></p>

<p class="center">EIGHT OR NINE WISE WORDS<br /><small>ABOUT</small><br />LETTER-WRITING</p>

<p><i>which their author had printed and used to send to his acquaintance,
accompanied by a small case for postage-stamps.</i></p>

<p><i>It consists of forty pages, and is published by Emberlin and Son, Oxford;
and these are the contents:</i></p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td align="right"><small>PAGE</small></td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="smcap">On Stamp-Cases</span>,</td><td align="right">5</td></tr>

<tr><td><span class="smcap">How to end a Letter</span>,</td><td align="right">20</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="smcap">On Registering Correspondence</span>,</td><td align="right">22</td></tr></table>

<p><i>In this little script, also, there are the same sparkles of wit which
betoken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span> that nimble pen, as, for example, under</i> &#8216;How to begin a Letter&#8217;:</p>

<p>&#8216;&#8220;And never, never, dear madam&#8221; (N.B.&mdash;This remark is addressed to ladies
<i>only</i>. No <i>man</i> would ever do such a thing), &#8220;put &#8216;Wednesday&#8217; simply as
the date! &#8220;<i>That way madness lies!</i>&#8221;&#8217;</p>

<p><i>From section 3</i>: &#8216;How to go on with a Letter.&#8217;&mdash;&#8216;A great deal of the bad
writing in the world comes simply from writing too <i>quickly</i>. Of course
you reply, &#8220;I do it to save <i>time</i>.&#8221; A very good object, no doubt, but
what right have you to do it at your friend&#8217;s expense? Isn&#8217;t <i>his</i> time as
valuable as yours? Years ago I used to receive letters from a friend&mdash;and
very interesting letters too&mdash;written in one of the most atrocious hands
ever invented. It generally took me about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span> a <i>week</i> to read one of his
letters! I used to carry it about in my pocket and take it out at leisure
times, to puzzle over the riddles which composed it&mdash;holding it in
different positions and at different distances, till at last the meaning
of some hopeless scrawl would flash upon me, when I at once wrote down the
English under it. And when several had been thus guessed the context would
help one with the others, till at last the whole series of hieroglyphics
was deciphered. If <i>all</i> one&#8217;s friends wrote like that, life would be
entirely spent in reading their letters!&#8217;</p>

<p><i>Rule for correspondence that has, unfortunately, become</i> controversial.</p>

<p>&#8216;<i>Don&#8217;t repeat yourself.</i>&mdash;When once you have had your say fully and
clearly on a certain point, and have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span> failed to convince your friend,
<i>drop that subject</i>. To repeat your arguments all over again, will simply
lead to his doing the same, and so you will go on like a circulating
decimal. <i>Did you ever know a circulating decimal come to an end?</i>&#8217;</p>

<p><br /><i>Rule 5.</i>&mdash;&#8216;If your friend makes a severe remark, either leave it
unnoticed, or make your reply distinctly less severe; and if he makes a
friendly remark, tending towards making up the little difference that has
arisen between you, let your reply be distinctly <i>more</i> friendly.</p>

<p><br />&#8216;If, in picking a quarrel, each party declined to go more than
<i>three-eighths</i> of the way, and if in making friends, each was ready to go
<i>five-eighths</i> of the way&mdash;why, there would be more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span> reconciliations than
quarrels! Which is like the Irishman&#8217;s remonstrance to his gad-about
daughter: &#8220;Shure, you&#8217;re <i>always</i> goin&#8217; out! You go out three times for
<i>wanst</i> that you come in!&#8221;&#8217;</p>

<p><br /><i>Rule 6.</i>&mdash;&#8216;Don&#8217;t try to get the last word.... (N.B.&mdash;If you are a
gentleman and your friend a lady, this rule is superfluous: <i>You won&#8217;t get
the last word!</i>)&#8217;</p>

<p><br /><i>Let the last word to-day be part of another rule, which gives a glimpse
into that gentle heart:</i></p>

<p>&#8216;When you have written a letter that you feel may possibly irritate your
friend, however necessary you may have felt it to so express yourself,
<i>put it aside till the next day</i>. Then read it over again, and fancy it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
addressed to yourself. This will often lead to your writing it all over
again, taking out a lot of the vinegar and pepper and putting in honey
instead, and thus making a <i>much</i> more palatable dish of it!&#8217;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="big">FEEDING THE MIND</span></p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="caps">Breakfast,</span> dinner, tea; in extreme cases, breakfast, luncheon, dinner,
tea, supper, and a glass of something hot at bedtime. What care we take
about feeding the lucky body! Which of us does as much for his mind? And
what causes the difference? Is the body so much the more important of the
two?</p>

<p>By no means: but life depends on the body being fed, whereas we can
continue to exist as animals (scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> as men) though the mind be
utterly starved and neglected. Therefore Nature provides that, in case of
serious neglect of the body, such terrible consequences of discomfort and
pain shall ensue, as will soon bring us back to a sense of our duty: and
some of the functions necessary to life she does for us altogether,
leaving us no choice in the matter. It would fare but ill with many of us
if we were left to superintend our own digestion and circulation. &#8216;Bless
me!&#8217; one would cry, &#8216;I forgot to wind up my heart this morning! To think
that it has been standing still for the last three hours!&#8217; &#8216;I can&#8217;t walk
with you this afternoon,&#8217; a friend would say, &#8216;as I have no less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> than
eleven dinners to digest. I had to let them stand over from last week,
being so busy, and my doctor says he will not answer for the consequences
if I wait any longer!&#8217;</p>

<p>Well, it is, I say, for us that the consequences of neglecting the body
can be clearly seen and felt; and it might be well for some if the mind
were equally visible and tangible&mdash;if we could take it, say, to the
doctor, and have its pulse felt.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, what have you been doing with this mind lately? How have you fed it?
It looks pale, and the pulse is very slow.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, doctor, it has not had much regular food lately. I gave it a lot of
sugar-plums yesterday.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>&#8216;Sugar-plums! What kind?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, they were a parcel of conundrums, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ah, I thought so. Now just mind this: if you go on playing tricks like
that, you&#8217;ll spoil all its teeth, and get laid up with mental indigestion.
You must have nothing but the plainest reading for the next few days. Take
care now! No novels on any account!&#8217;</p>

<p><br />Considering the amount of painful experience many of us have had in
feeding and dosing the body, it would, I think, be quite worth our while
to try and translate some of the rules into corresponding ones for the
mind.</p>

<p>First, then, we should set ourselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> to provide for our mind its <i>proper
kind</i> of food. We very soon learn what will, and what will not, agree with
the body, and find little difficulty in refusing a piece of the tempting
pudding or pie which is associated in our memory with that terrible attack
of indigestion, and whose very name irresistibly recalls rhubarb and
magnesia; but it takes a great many lessons to convince us how
indigestible some of our favourite lines of reading are, and again and
again we make a meal of the unwholesome novel, sure to be followed by its
usual train of low spirits, unwillingness to work, weariness of
existence&mdash;in fact, by mental nightmare.</p>

<p>Then we should be careful to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>provide this wholesome food in <i>proper
amount</i>. Mental gluttony, or over-reading, is a dangerous propensity,
tending to weakness of digestive power, and in some cases to loss of
appetite: we know that bread is a good and wholesome food, but who would
like to try the experiment of eating two or three loaves at a sitting?</p>

<p>I have heard a physician telling his patient&mdash;whose complaint was merely
gluttony and want of exercise&mdash;that &#8216;the earliest symptom of
hyper-nutrition is a deposition of adipose tissue,&#8217; and no doubt the fine
long words greatly consoled the poor man under his increasing load of
fat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>I wonder if there is such a thing in nature as a FAT MIND? I really think I
have met with one or two: minds which could not keep up with the slowest
trot in conversation; could not jump over a logical fence, to save their
lives; always got stuck fast in a narrow argument; and, in short, were fit
for nothing but to waddle helplessly through the world.</p>

<p><br />Then, again, though the food be wholesome and in proper amount, we know
that we must not consume <i>too many kinds at once</i>. Take the thirsty a
quart of beer, or a quart of cider, or even a quart of cold tea, and he
will probably thank you (though not so heartily in the last case!). But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
what think you his feelings would be if you offered him a tray containing
a little mug of beer, a little mug of cider, another of cold tea, one of
hot tea, one of coffee, one of cocoa, and corresponding vessels of milk,
water, brandy-and-water, and butter-milk? The sum total might be a quart,
but would it be the same thing to the haymaker?</p>

<p><br />Having settled the proper kind, amount, and variety of our mental food, it
remains that we should be careful to allow <i>proper intervals</i> between meal
and meal, and not swallow the food hastily without mastication, so that it
may be thoroughly digested; both which rules, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> body, are also
applicable at once to the mind.</p>

<p>First, as to the intervals: these are as really necessary as they are for
the body, with this difference only, that while the body requires three or
four hours&#8217; rest before it is ready for another meal, the mind will in
many cases do with three or four minutes. I believe that the interval
required is much shorter than is generally supposed, and from personal
experience, I would recommend anyone, who has to devote several hours
together to one subject of thought, to try the effect of such a break, say
once an hour, leaving off for five minutes only each time, but taking care
to throw the mind absolutely &#8216;out of gear&#8217; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> those five minutes, and
to turn it entirely to other subjects. It is astonishing what an amount of
impetus and elasticity the mind recovers during those short periods of
rest.</p>

<p>And then, as to the mastication of the food, the mental process answering
to this is simply <i>thinking over</i> what we read. This is a very much
greater exertion of mind than the mere passive taking in the contents of
our Author. So much greater an exertion is it, that, as Coleridge says,
the mind often &#8216;angrily refuses&#8217; to put itself to such trouble&mdash;so much
greater, that we are far too apt to neglect it altogether, and go on
pouring in fresh food on the top of the undigested masses already lying
there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> till the unfortunate mind is fairly swamped under the flood. But
the greater the exertion the more valuable, we may be sure, is the effect.
One hour of steady thinking over a subject (a solitary walk is as good an
opportunity for the process as any other) is worth two or three of reading
only. And just consider another effect of this thorough digestion of the
books we read; I mean the arranging and &#8216;ticketing,&#8217; so to speak, of the
subjects in our minds, so that we can readily refer to them when we want
them. Sam Slick tells us that he has learnt several languages in his life,
but somehow &#8216;couldn&#8217;t keep the parcels sorted&#8217; in his mind. And many a
mind that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> hurries through book after book, without waiting to digest or
arrange anything, gets into that sort of condition, and the unfortunate
owner finds himself far from fit really to support the character all his
friends give him.</p>

<p>&#8216;A thoroughly well-read man. Just you try him in any subject, now. You
can&#8217;t puzzle him.&#8217;</p>

<p>You turn to the thoroughly well-read man. You ask him a question, say, in
English history (he is understood to have just finished reading Macaulay).
He smiles good-naturedly, tries to look as if he knew all about it, and
proceeds to dive into his mind for the answer. Up comes a handful of very
promising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> facts, but on examination they turn out to belong to the wrong
century, and are pitched in again. A second haul brings up a fact much
more like the real thing, but, unfortunately, along with it comes a tangle
of other things&mdash;a fact in political economy, a rule in arithmetic, the
ages of his brother&#8217;s children, and a stanza of Gray&#8217;s &#8216;Elegy,&#8217; and among
all these, the fact he wants has got hopelessly twisted up and entangled.
Meanwhile, every one is waiting for his reply, and, as the silence is
getting more and more awkward, our well-read friend has to stammer out
some half-answer at last, not nearly so clear or so satisfactory as an
ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> schoolboy would have given. And all this for want of making up
his knowledge into proper bundles and ticketing them.</p>

<p>Do you know the unfortunate victim of ill-judged mental feeding when you
see him? Can you doubt him? Look at him drearily wandering round a
reading-room, tasting dish after dish&mdash;we beg his pardon, book after
book&mdash;keeping to none. First a mouthful of novel; but no, faugh! he has
had nothing but that to eat for the last week, and is quite tired of the
taste. Then a slice of science; but you know at once what the result of
that will be&mdash;ah, of course, much too tough for <i>his</i> teeth. And so on
through the whole weary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> round, which he tried (and failed in) yesterday,
and will probably try and fail in to-morrow.</p>

<p>Mr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, in his very amusing book, &#8216;The Professor at the
Breakfast Table,&#8217; gives the following rule for knowing whether a human
being is young or old: &#8216;The crucial experiment is this&mdash;offer a bulky bun
to the suspected individual just ten minutes before dinner. If this is
easily accepted and devoured, the fact of youth is established.&#8217; He tells
us that a human being, &#8216;if young, will eat anything at any hour of the day
or night.&#8217;</p>

<p>To ascertain the healthiness of the <i>mental</i> appetite of a human animal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
place in its hands a short, well-written, but not exciting treatise on
some popular subject&mdash;a mental <i>bun</i>, in fact. If it is read with eager
interest and perfect attention, <i>and if the reader can answer questions on
the subject afterwards</i>, the mind is in first-rate working order. If it be
politely laid down again, or perhaps lounged over for a few minutes, and
then, &#8216;I can&#8217;t read this stupid book! Would you hand me the second volume
of &#8220;The Mysterious Murder&#8221;?&#8217; you may be equally sure that there is
something wrong in the mental digestion.</p>

<p>If this paper has given you any useful hints on the important subject of
reading, and made you see that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> is one&#8217;s duty no less than one&#8217;s
interest to &#8216;read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest&#8217; the good books that
fall in your way, its purpose will be fulfilled.</p>

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
